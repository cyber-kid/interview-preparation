# Classes

Following the standard Java convention, a class should begin with a list of variables. Public static constants, if any, should come first. Then private static variables, followed by private instance variables. There is seldom a good reason to have a public variable. Public functions should follow the list of variables. We like to put the private utilities called by a public function right after the public function itself. This follows the stepdown rule and helps the program read like a newspaper article.

The name of a class should describe what responsibilities it fulfills. In fact, naming is probably the first way of helping determine class size. If we cannot derive a concise name for a class, then itâ€™s likely too large. The more ambiguous the class name, the more likely it has too many responsibilities. For example, class names including weasel words like *Processor* or *Manager* or *Super* often hint at unfortunate aggregation of responsibilities.

***

The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)2 states that a class or module should have one, and only one, reason to change. Trying to identify responsibilities (reasons to change) often helps us recognize and create better abstractions in our code.

***

Classes should have a small number of instance variables. Each of the methods of a class should manipulate one or more of those variables. In general the more variables a method manipulates the more cohesive that method is to its class. A class in which each variable is used by each method is maximally cohesive. In general it is neither advisable nor possible to create such maximally cohesive classes; on the other hand, we would like cohesion to be high. When cohesion is high, it means that the methods and variables of the class are co-dependent and hang together as a logical whole.

***

You should try to separate the variables and methods into two or more classes such that the new classes are more cohesive.

***

The strategy of keeping functions small and keeping parameter lists short can sometimes lead to a proliferation of instance variables that are used by a subset of methods. When this happens, it almost always means that there is at least one other class trying to get out of the larger class.

***

We want to structure our systems so that we muck with as little as possible when we update them with new or changed features. In an ideal system, we incorporate new features by extending the system, not by making modifications to existing code.

***

The lack of coupling means that the elements of our system are better isolated from each other and from change. This isolation makes it easier to understand each element of the system. By minimizing coupling in this way, our classes adhere to another class design principle known as the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP). In essence, the DIP says that our classes should depend upon abstractions, not on concrete details.
