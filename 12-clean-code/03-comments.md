# Comments

Comments should say things that the code cannot say for itself.

***

It is inappropriate for a comment to hold information better held in a different kind of system such as your source code control system, your issue tracking system, or any other record-keeping system. Change histories, for example, just clutter up source files with volumes of historical and uninteresting text.

***

A comment that has gotten old, irrelevant, and incorrect is obsolete. If you find an obsolete comment, it is best to update it or get rid of it as quickly as possible. Obsolete comments tend to migrate away from the code they once described.

When you see commented-out code, delete it! Donâ€™t worry, the source code control system still remembers it.
