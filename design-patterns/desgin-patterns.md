# General information
#### OO Principles
- Encapsulate what varies.
- Favor composition over inheritance.
- Program to interfaces, not implementations.
- Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
- Classes should be opened for extension and closed for modification.

#### Strategy Pattern
Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

#### Observer Pattern
Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

#### Decorator Pattern
Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
