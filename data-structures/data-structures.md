# Data structures
## Arrays
* Predefined size;
* Ordered;
#### Insert
**O(1)** New element is always inserted in last available cell.

**O(N)** if the array is sorted, new item should be compared with already existing one to find a proper place where ti put it and existing items should be shiftem to make room for a new one.
#### Delete
**O(N)** You need first to find the item and after deletion shift all items coming after deleted one to fill the empty cell.

**O(N)** if the array is sorted to find an item will take O(logN) but it is still need to shift the remaining ones to fill the empty cell.
#### Search
**O(N)** In worst case you need to check all items.

**O(logN)** if the array is sorted we can use binary search.
## Stacks
* LIFO (Last-In-First-Out);
#### Push
**O(1)** New element is inserted int the top cell of the Stack.
#### Pop
**O(1)** The element is taken from the top cell of the Stack (and the element is deleted).
#### Peek
**O(1)** The same as Pop() but the element is not deleted.
## Queues
* FIFO (First-In-First-Out);
#### Add (Offer)
**O(1)** New element is inserted int the top cell of the Queue.
#### Remove (Poll)
**O(1)** The element is taken from the bottom cell of the Queue (and the element is deleted).
#### Element (Peek)
**O(1)** The same as Remove() but the element is not deleted.
#### Notes
1. To avoid the problem of not being able to insert more items into the queue even when itâ€™s not full, the Front and Rear pointers wrap around to the beginning of the array. The result is a circular queue (sometimes called a ring buffer).
## Priority Queues
* FIFO (First-In-First-Out);
* Items are prioritized (sorted);
#### Add (Offer)
**O(N)** For new element to be inserted we need to compare it with other elements and if needed tshift them.
#### Remove (Poll)
**O(1)** The element is taken from the bottom cell of the Priority Queue (and the element is deleted).
#### Element (Peek)
**O(1)** The same as Remove() but the element is not deleted.
