# Notes
Many transformations of domain models and the corresponding code take the form of recognizing a concept that has been hinted at, present implicitly, and representing it with one or more explicit objects or relationships in the model.

***

Identify each model in play on the project and define its BOUNDED CONTEXT. This includes the implicit models of non-object-oriented subsystems. Name each BOUNDED CONTEXT, and make the names part of the UBIQUITOUS LANGUAGE. Describe the points of contact between the models, outlining explicit translation for any communication and highlighting any sharing.
