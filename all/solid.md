# SOLID Principles
1. **Single responsibility Principle**Â One class should have one and only one responsibility.
2. **Open Closed Principle** Software components should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
3. **Liskov`s Substitution Principle** Derived types must be completely substitutable for their base types.
4. **Interface Segregation Principle** Clients should not be forced to implement unnecessary methods which they will not use. (Solution is to create two interfaces by breaking the existing one)
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle** Depend on abstractions, not on concretions. (In other words. you should design your software in such a way that various modules can be separated from each other using an abstract layer to bind them together.)
